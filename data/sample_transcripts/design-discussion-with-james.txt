Meeting: Design System Review
Date: February 3, 2026
Duration: 60 minutes
Attendees: James (Creative Director), Bob Martinez (Design Lead), David Kim (Frontend Lead), Alice Chen (PM)

James: Thanks for putting this meeting together, Bob. I've been looking at the component library progress and have some thoughts on the design tokens.

Bob: Absolutely. We're about 60% through the component library. David has been great at translating the designs to React components.

David: Thanks! The main challenge right now is consistency between our Figma specs and the actual implementation. We're seeing some color and spacing drift.

James: That's exactly what I wanted to address. Bob, can you audit the existing components against our brand guidelines? I'd like a report by end of next week.

Bob: I can definitely do that. Should I prioritize any specific components?

James: Start with the primary buttons, form inputs, and the navigation components. Those are what users interact with most.

Alice: From a product standpoint, we're planning to use the new design system for the mobile app redesign. Can we have the core components ready by the end of February?

Bob: That's ambitious but doable. David, can you commit to having the button and form components production-ready by February 20th?

David: I can make that work if I can get final Figma specs by this Friday.

Bob: Done. I'll finalize the Figma specs by Friday, February 7th.

James: One more thing - we need to update our Storybook documentation. It's getting outdated. David, can you refresh the component stories?

David: Sure, I'll allocate some time next sprint. Should have updated documentation by February 25th.

Alice: Perfect. I'll update the product roadmap to reflect these timelines. Thanks everyone!
